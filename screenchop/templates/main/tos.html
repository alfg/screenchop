                        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
                        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                        <p>If someone else might own the copyright to it, don’t upload it. Don’t upload gore, obscenity, advertising, solicitations, "hate speech" (i.e. demeaning race, gender, age, religious or sexual orientation, etc.), or material that is threatening, harassing, defamatory, or that encourages illegality. Don’t hotlink to such content, or to file-sharing or torrent sites. If you do anything illegal, in addition to any other legal rights we may have, we will ban you along with the site you're hotlinking from, delete all your images, report you to the authorities if necessary, and prevent you from accessing images on Screenchop.</p>

                        <h3>Full Terms</h3>
                        <p>Accessing any page of our website other than our home page and this "Terms" page constitutes your consent to these terms of use and to our Privacy Policy. If you do not consent, do not use our website. 

Your use of our website to do anything beyond simply accessing/viewing it (that is, uploading, downloading, commenting, etc.), constitutes not merely your consent, but also your electronic signature, meaning that you are contractually bound by these terms and by our Privacy Policy.</p>

                        <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
                        <p>By uploading a file or other content or by making a comment, you represent and warrant to us that (1) doing so does not violate or infringe anyone else’s rights; and (2) you created the file or other content you are uploading, or otherwise have sufficient intellectual property rights to upload the material consistent with these terms. With regard to any file or content you upload to the public portions of our site, you grant Screenchop a non-exclusive, royalty- free, perpetual, irrevocable worldwide license (with sublicense and assignment rights) to use, to display online and in any present or future media, to create derivative works of, to allow downloads of, and/or distribute any such file or content. To the extent that you delete a such file or content from the public portions of our site, the license you grant to Screenchop pursuant to the preceding sentence will automatically terminate, but will not be revoked with respect to any file or content Screenchop has already copied and sublicensed or designated for sublicense. Also, of course, anything you post to a public portion of our site may be used by the public pursuant to the following paragraph even after you delete it. 

By downloading a file or other content from the Screenchop site, you agree that you will not use such file or other content except for personal, non-commercial purposes, and you may not claim any rights to such file or other content, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided in writing. </p>

                        <h5>Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitations of Remedies, Indemnity</h5>
                        <p>Although of course we strive to make Screenchop as dependable as possible, Screenchop’s services are provided on an AS IS – WITH ALL FAULTS basis. Your use of our service is entirely at your own risk. We do not guarantee the availability of our service at any given time, or the reliability of our service when it is running. We do not guarantee the integrity of, or the continued availability of files on, our servers. Whether we make backups, and if so whether restoration of those backups will be available to you, is at our discretion. SCREENCHOP DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS AND MERCHANTABILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE STATED IN THESE TERMS, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER SCREENCHOP TAKES OR DOES NOT TAKE MEASURES TO REMOVE INAPPROPRIATE OR HARMFUL CONTENT FROM ITS SITE, SCREENCHOP HAS NO DUTY TO MONITOR ANY CONTENT ON ITS SITE. SCREENCHOP DOES NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, APPROPRIATENESS, OR HARMLESSNESS OF ANY CONTENT APPEARING ON SCREENCHOP.COM THAT IS NOT PRODUCED BY SCREENCHOP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO USER CONTENT, ADVERTISING CONTENT, OR OTHERWISE. 

SCREENCHOP’S liability for the loss of any services and/or of any images or other data you may have stored on Screenchop’s service is limited to a refund of the cost, pro-rated if applicable, of the most recent month of service (if you have paid for an Screenchop Pro subscription). Otherwise, your sole remedy is to discontinue the use of our service. SCREENCHOP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, SCREENCHOP'S SERVICES, EVEN IF SCREENCHOP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NO CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF SCREENCHOP'S SERVICES MAY BE BROUGHT MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER IT ACCRUES. 

YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SCREENCHOP AND ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL HARMLESS FROM ALL LOSS, LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS, YOUR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY’S RIGHTS, AND ANY HARM CAUSED TO ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF YOUR UPLOADING OF FILES, COMMENTS, OR ANYTHING ELSE TO OUR SERVERS.</p>

                        <h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
                        <p>"Screenchop" or "we" refers to Screenchop. "You" refers to any person who has consented to these terms or has become contractually bound to them, whether such person is identified or not at the time. These terms are governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law principles, and if there is a lawsuit between you and Screenchop, jurisdiction and venue will lie exclusively in the State where the defendant is located, if within the United States, or in Santa Clara County, California otherwise. If any part of these terms is invalid, the remaining provisions will be unaffected. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to this subject matter, and they will continue to govern any issues that arise out of your use of Screenchop's services even after you discontinue using them. We may revise these terms from time to time without notice. Whenever we do so, we will so indicate by changing the version date at the top. Any changes apply as of the time they are posted. Screenchop is not meant for use by children under age 13; if your child is younger than 13 please allow him or her to use it only under your supervision.</p>
